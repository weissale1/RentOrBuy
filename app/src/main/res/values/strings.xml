        Hi, my name is Alex.
        \n\nThis is the first app I ever build.
        \nIt is mainly a practical exercise for me to
        get into modern app development on Android.
        \nIf you found this app usefully in any way, I would
        be very happy to hear about in the Play Store.
        \n\nI am also happy to hear about any bugs, improvement ideas, etc.
        \n\nRent or Buy is build with Jetpack Compose and Material3.
