Most simple Android App that I could think of.

Used to try Jetpack Compose with Kotlin.

Findings:
1. I like Kotlin and Jetpack Compose is an interesting framework.
2. Publishing an app via the Play Store is something I do not enjoy.
3. Having to deal with device specific problems is something I do not enjoy.
